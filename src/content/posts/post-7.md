This guide is here to help you get an A in math. 

It’s based on learning strategies that worked for me—I went from an L1R5 of 22 in midterms to an L1R5 of 6 in prelims using these ideas. 

I’ve shared this with other students and they saw big improvements in their grades in just a few months. 

The advice here applies to math and can work for your other subjects as well. Following it isn’t easy, but it’s worth the effort.

# Finding Motivation To Study

Studying because your parents or teacher make you feels awful. 

But it’s different when you feel like you’re on a quest, working toward something you care about—like leveling up in a game and gaining new skills. The key is knowing ***why*** you study.

Your why could be simple, like:

“I want to do well in math to impress my crush and maybe get together with them.” 

Or it could be something bigger, like “I’ll study so I can earn enough money to support myself and my future family.”

Whatever it is, think hard to find a reason that feels real to you—something you believe deep down.

When you have your why, studying turns into steps toward that goal. 

Maybe you’re working to impress that guy or girl, or setting yourself up for a good future—or both. 

If you can’t find a why, think about what happens if you don’t study. Realizing you might not earn enough to live the way you want because you didn’t try hard can push you to study without needing extra motivation.

# What Learning Feels Like

Learning is supposed to feel hard. You should feel strained when you’re doing it.

If it’s too comfortable, you’re just going over what you already know, and that’s not progress. 

To learn fast, push yourself past what’s easy for longer than feels natural, and make it as enjoyable—or at least bearable—as you can.

You’ll get used to the challenge with practice. When it starts feeling manageable, push harder. 

The goal is to feel uncertain while you’re learning. That’s normal, and it means you’re growing. You’ll only feel confident later, when you look back and see how easy the exam was. 

**Here’s how it ranks:**
enjoyable hard studying is better than unenjoyable hard studying, which is still way more useful than studying stuff you already know, especially if it’s boring.

# How to Study

These principles will help you learn any subject well. They’re about learning how to learn, and you can use them to get better at anything fast.

### 1. Recall, Don’t Reread

Don’t just listen to your teacher or read your textbook without doing anything. 

Learning takes effort. 

Close your book and try writing out the quadratic formula. 

If you can’t remember it all, that’s okay—try your best without looking. The struggle is what helps you learn. After you’ve tried, check the book to see what you missed. This works better than reading or highlighting. 

Recall what you read, wait an hour, and try again—it’s harder but more effective.

### 2. Chunk Your Problems

Break tough math problems into smaller parts.

For example, to get “I ate 3/8 of the pizza,” first understand what a whole pizza is, that it’s cut into 8 equal slices, and that 3 slices are part of it. 

Once you know the basics well, you don’t have to think about them anymore, which leaves room for harder problems. 

If a problem’s confusing, it means you need to go back to earlier chapters and practice simpler stuff. 

Master that first before moving on—otherwise, you’re wasting time.

### 3. Test Yourself

Test yourself often, not just for exams.

It helps your brain hold onto what you’ve learned. This isn’t only about practice papers. After your teacher explains a concept, repeat it silently in your head to test if you get it. That makes it easier to remember later.

It doesn’t matter how well you do—the act of testing helps you learn. Struggling is a good sign.

### 4. Solve Different Problems

When practicing, mix up topics in one session—like prime numbers, algebra, and geometry. 

That’s what past-year papers and TYS do: they teach you when to use a concept, not just how. 

If you only focus on one topic at a time, you won’t learn how to pick the right approach in an exam.

### 5. Focus

Cut out distractions and study in short, intense bursts. No phone, no chatting with friends. 

The Pomodoro Technique works well: focus for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, do 4 rounds, then rest for 20 minutes. 

You could aim for 12 to 16 Pomodoros a day. 

If you manage 3 to 4 hours of real focus daily, you’ll do well in lots of subjects.

### 6. Take Breaks

After focusing, you’ll get tired. 

If you’re stuck or can’t think straight, take a break. 

Go for a walk, nap, or play a game. 

Breaks stop you from getting frustrated and let your mind work on things quietly. 

That’s why a walk or nap after studying can help you solve a problem fast when you come back.

### 7. Eat Your Frogs First

Start with the hardest tasks when you’re fresh. 

Procrastination comes from avoiding tough stuff, so tackle that big algebra problem early. 

Getting it done builds momentum for the day.

### 8. Use Analogies and Metaphors

To understand a tricky concept, connect it to something familiar.

For negative numbers, think of a video game character’s health points. Zero HP is like zero on the number line. Gaining +5 HP moves you right; losing -7 HP moves you left. If you have 10 HP and lose 15, you’re at -5 HP—past zero into negatives. 

It makes the idea easier to grasp.

### 9. Space Your Studying

Spread out your study sessions instead of cramming. 

This “spaced repetition” is like exercising regularly to build muscle—it helps your brain store things long-term. 

Study a little math each day rather than all at once before a test.

### 10. Make a Mental Contrast

Think about where you are now compared to where good math skills could take you. 

Maybe you’re struggling with fractions today, but later you’ll handle tough equations easily. 

That difference can keep you going when it’s hard.

# Other Study Tips

### Handling Mental Roadblocks

You’ll hit roadblocks while learning—it’s part of it. 

If you’re stuck too long, step away. Exercise, sleep, or talk to friends. 

For really hard stuff, sleep on it and try again tomorrow. 

More time between sessions can help you understand tricky concepts. 

Your brain has a focused mode and a diffused mode—both matter, and breaks let the diffused mode do its job.

### Sleep

Imagine something that could make you 30% smarter. That’s sleep. 

Don’t study when you’re exhausted—nap first. 

Set an alarm for bedtime (like 11 PM) and have a routine, like reading a fun book. Stop working 1-2 hours before bed to let your brain relax.

### Beware of the Illusion of Competence

Reading without doing anything makes you think you understand when you don’t. 

You learn more when you’re active—explaining things to yourself or doing problems. 

For math, practice questions are the best way to know you’ve really got it.

### Use AI as a Study Partner

AI can explain math in a way that makes sense to you. 

Take a photo of a problem, and tools like [The Wise Otter](https://t.me/TheWiseOtterBot) can solve it or break it down. 

Ask it to simplify, use an analogy, or point out your mistakes. It’s patient and always there to help.

# What Next?

You don’t have to do everything here. Start with 1 or 2 things. An hour of focused work a day is fine—just build from there. 

Don’t have a why yet? That’s okay, but start thinking about it. 

Keep going, and eventually math might even get fun. 

Enjoy the journey and trust the process. Happy studying!
